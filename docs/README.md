# Rubik's Cube

## Overview

This is a project for a subject called "Algoritmos BÃ¡sicos de la Inteligencia Artificial" (Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms) that accounted for 20% of the final grade. It was made by a team of 2 people. The submission took place on Monday, the 8th of April of 2024, and earned a grade of 10 out of 10 points.

## Project Summary

For this project we had to try different types of algorithms to solve a Rubik's Cube. For some algorithms we had to implement a heuristic function so we tried several. With the different algorithms and heuristic functions we had to see the combinatorial explosion and define metrics to see the efficiency of the algorithms.
